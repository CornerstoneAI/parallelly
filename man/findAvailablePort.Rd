\usage{
findAvailablePort(ports = 1024:65535, default = NA_integer_, randomize = FALSE)

canPortBeUsed(port)
}
\arguments{
\item{ports}{(integer vector) TCP ports in [0, 65535] to scan.}

\item{default}{(integer) \code{NA_integer_} or a port to returned if
an available port could not be found.}

\item{randomize}{(logical) If TRUE, \code{ports} is randomly shuffled
before searched.  This shuffle does \emph{not} forward the RNG seed.}

\item{port}{(integer) A TCP port in [0, 65535].}
}
\value{
\code{findAvailablePort(ports)} returns an integer representing the first
port among \code{ports} that can be opened.  If none can be opened, then
\code{default} is returned.  If port querying is not supported, as in
R (< 4.0.0), then \code{default} is returned.

\code{canPortBeUsed(port)} returns a logical indicating whether the port can
be opened or not, or cannot be queried.  If the port can be opened,
then \code{TRUE} is returned, if cannot be opened then \code{FALSE} is returned,
which may happen if the port is used by another process.
If port querying is not supported, as in R (< 4.0.0),  then \code{NA} is
returned.
