\title{Check whether or not the cluster nodes are alive}
\usage{
isWorkerAlive(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A cluster or a cluster node ("worker").}

\item{...}{Not used.}
}
\value{
A logical vector of length \code{length(x)} with values
FALSE, TRUE, and NA.  If it can be established that the
process for a cluster node is running, then TRUE is returned.
If it does not run, then FALSE is returned.
If neither can be inferred, for instance because the worker
runs on a remote machine, then NA is returned.
