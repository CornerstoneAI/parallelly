\title{Maximum Number of Concurrent Connections Possible}
\usage{
maxConnections()
}
\value{
A non-negative integer, or \code{+Inf} if the maximum number
is greated than 65536
(or what option \option{parallelly.maxConnections.tries} specified).
}
\description{
The number of \link{connections} that can be open at the same time in \R is
\emph{typically} 128, where the first three are occupied by the always open
\code{\link[=stdin]{stdin()}}, \code{\link[=stdout]{stdout()}}, and \code{\link[=stderr]{stderr()}} connections, which leaves 125 slots
available for other types of connections.  For example, this limit limits
how many nodes a parallel cluster can have.
}
\section{How to increase the limit}{

This limit of 128 connections can only be changed by rebuilding \R from
source.  The limited is hardcoded as a\if{html}{\out{<div class="c">}}\preformatted{#define NCONNECTIONS 128 /* snow needs one per slave node */
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

in \file{src/main/connections.c}.
}

\section{How this function finds the limit}{

Since the limit \emph{can} be changed, we do not want to assume that the limit
is 128 for all \R installation.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to
ask \R what the limit is.  Instead, this function infers it from
trial-and-error.  More specifically, it attempts to open as many concurrent
connections as possible until it fails.  The result will be memoized to
return returned in any succeeding calls.
